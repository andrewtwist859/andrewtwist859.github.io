<p style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 30px;"><i>from <a style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: 700; color:black" href="http://www.matthaig.com/books/thehumans/">The Humans</a> by Matt Haig</p></i>
<p><span class="number">1. </span>Shame is a shackle. Free yourself.</p>
<p><span class="number">2. </span>Don’t worry about your abilities. You have the ability to love. That is enough.</p>
<p><span class="number">3. </span>Be nice to other people. <span class='green-highlight'>At a universal level, they are you.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">4. </span>Technology won’t save mankind. Humans will.</p>
<p><span class="number">5. </span>Laugh. It suits you.</p>
<p><span class="number">6. </span>Be curious. Question everything. A present fact is just a future fiction.</p>
<p><span class="number">7. </span>Irony is fine, but not as fine as feeling.</p>
<p><span class="number">8. </span>Sometimes to be yourself you will have to forget yourself and become something else. <span class='green-highlight'>Your character is not a fixed thing.</span> You will sometimes have to move to keep up with it.</p>
<p><span class="number">9. </span>You shouldn’t have been born. Your existence is as close to impossible as can be. <span class='green-highlight'>To dismiss the impossible is to dismiss yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">10. </span>The road to snobbery is the road to misery. And vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="number">11. </span>Tragedy is just comedy that hasn’t come to fruition. One day we will laugh at this. We will laugh at everything.</p>
<p><span class="number">12. </span>Happiness is not out <i>here</i>, it is in <i>there.</i></p>
<p><span class="number">13. </span>New technology on Earth, just means something that we will laugh at in five years. <span class='green-highlight'>Value the stuff you won’t laugh at in five years.</span> Like love. Or a good poem. Or a song. Or the sky.</p>
<p><span class="number">14. </span>If there is a sunset, stop and look at it. Knowledge is finite. <span class='green-highlight'>Wonder is infinite.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">15. </span>Don’t aim for perfection. Evolution, and life, only happen through mistakes.</p>
<p><span class="number">16. </span>Don’t always try to be cool. The whole universe is cool. <span class='green-highlight'>It’s the warm bits that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">17. </span>Walt Whitman was right about at least one thing. You will contradict yourself. You are large. You contain multitudes.</p>
<p><span class="number">18. </span>No one is ever completely right about anything. Anywhere.</p>
<p><span class="number">19. </span>Everyone is a comedy. If people are laughing at you they just don’t quite understand the joke that is themselves.</p>
<p><span class="number">20. </span>Your brain is open. Never let it be closed.</p>
<p><span class="number">21. </span>In a thousand years, if humans survive that long, everything you know will have been disproved. And replaced by even bigger myths.</p>
<p><span class="number">22. </span><span class='green-highlight'>You have the power to stop time.</span> You do it by kissing. Or listening to music. Music, by the way, is how you see things you can’t otherwise see. It is the most advanced thing you have. It is a superpower.</p>
<p><span class="number">23. </span>The things you don’t need to live (books, art, cinema, wine and so on) are the things you need to live.</p>
<p><span class="number">24. </span>No two moralities match. Accept different shapes, so long as they aren’t sharp enough to hurt.</p>
<p><span class="number">25. </span>At some point, bad things are going to happen. <span class='green-highlight'>Have someone to hold on to.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">26. </span>If you are laughing, check that you don’t really want to cry. And vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="number">27. </span>There are a lot of idiots in your species. Lots and lots. You are not one of them. Hold your ground.</p>
<p><span class="number">28. </span>It is not the length of life that matters. <span class='green-highlight'>It’s the depth.</span> But while burrowing, keep the sun above you.</p>
<p><span class="number">29. </span>Obey your head. Obey your heart. Obey your gut. In fact, obey everything except commands.</p>
<p><span class="number">30. </span>One day, if you get into a position of power, tell people this: <span class='green-highlight'>just because you can, it doesn’t mean you should.</span> There is a power and a beauty in unproved conjectures, unkissed lips and unpicked flowers.</p>
<p><span class="number">31. </span>Start fires. But only metaphorically. Unless you are cold and it’s a safe setting. In which case: start fires.</p>
<p><span class="number">32. </span>Most humans don’t think about things very much. They survive by thinking about needs and wants alone. But you are not one of them. Be careful.</p>
<p><span class="number">33. </span>No one will understand you. It is not, ultimately, that important. <span class='green-highlight'>What is important is that <i>you</i> understand you.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">34. </span>Politeness is often fear. Kindness is always courage. But caring is what makes you human. Care more, become more human.</p>
<p><span class="number">35. </span>You get up. You put on your clothes. And then you put on your personality. <span class='green-highlight'>Choose wisely.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">36. </span><span class='green-highlight'>You are more than the sum of your particles.</span> And that is quite a sum.</p>
<p><span class="number">37. </span>Dark matter is needed to hold galaxies together. Your mind is a galaxy. More dark than light. But the light makes it worthwhile.</p>
<p><span class="number">38. </span>Men are not from Mars. Women are not from Venus. Do not fall for categories. Everyone is everything. <span class='green-highlight'>Every ingredient inside a star is inside you, and every personality that ever existed competes in the theatre of your mind for the main role.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">39. </span>As a black hole forms it creates an immense gamma-ray burst, blinding whole galaxies with light and destroying millions of worlds. You could disappear at any second. This one. Or this one. Or this one. <span class='green-highlight'>Make sure, as often as possible, you are doing something you’d be happy to die doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="number">40. </span><span class='green-highlight'>Be alive.</span> That is your supreme duty to the world.</p>
