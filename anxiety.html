        <h1 class="page-title">Anxiety, insecurity and getting sacked from my first proper job</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>My first proper job ended with a brief phone call. Unlike most calls, it wasn’t actually a conversation. It was a professional dressing down punctuated by awkward sobbing and sighs of acceptance.</p>
<p>I listened as the Managing Director told me he could see no way back for me in his agency. I had no response to his end-of-tether honesty.  A naive tailender with no answer to the experienced opening bowler. It took only a few crushing blows before he delivered the inevitable conclusion and sent me on my way.</p>
<p>This was only six months after he’d called to offer me a job. In that conversation he talked about how impressed they were in my interview. I’d replied with how excited I was to work for them.</p>
<p>How had things gone so wrong so quickly?</p>
<p>I’ve thought about that question a lot over the last six years.</p>
<p>Getting the job in Manchester felt like a big achievement and an even bigger relief. For the first time in a while I had clear sight of the future. It was free from the dizzying aura of career uncertainty in a post-university world.</p>
<p>And for the first few weeks it all seemed good. I worked for an award-winning PR agency in the city I call home. Even the commute from Sheffield wasn’t too draining.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before the anxiety kicked in.</p>
<p>It first reared its head when I was asked to ring journalists and pitch lukewarm stories with artificial enthusiasm. I’d feel the insecurity growing in my stomach at the thought of my colleagues hearing me fumble and stutter. Every call was like picking up a handful of vowels in a new game of Scrabble – I couldn’t find the words and I had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>This rudimentary seed of anxiety grew inside me at an alarming rate. Its roots constricting my confidence to complete even basic tasks. I soon convinced myself that everyone thought I was incapable and incompetent at my job. Before long I started to think they were right.</p>
<p>My naïve way of trying to deal with it was to close up and pretend that everything was ok.  But shutting everything out meant that I never got to know my colleagues. And they absolutely didn’t get to know me. Every day was nothing more than a silent, awkward battle to keep it together and get through until 5pm.</p>
<p>The first train to Manchester was now the last place I wanted to be each morning. Sat alone for an hour with the one person I couldn’t stand being around. I’d spend the journey beating myself up about my failings. I couldn’t understand why it seemed so hard. It wasn’t a particularly difficult job and yet I felt useless at it.  </p>
<p>Towards the end I’d try to sleep on the train – it was the simplest way to block things out and to stave off unwanted tears. If I couldn’t sleep, my favoured distraction was to mentally script minor catastrophes in my mind. Imagining scenarios that would either delay my arrival or give me a decent excuse to go home.</p>
<p>You know things are fucked when you are praying for signal failure and hoping to get a cold.</p>
<p>The evenings weren’t much better. I’d get home after 7pm and try to avoid any conversations about work with my then girlfriend. She tried her best to keep my spirits up and looked after me when all I wanted to do was sleep and escape everything.</p>
<p>I was paralysed by anxiety and insecurity when I should’ve been putting my hand up and asking for help. If I’d spoken more to her, the people at work and my friends and family then it might not have ended with that sad, brutal phone call.</p>
<p>My immediate reaction to being sacked was, oddly, one of absolute relief and elation that I’d never have to go back there. This was soon followed by intense fear as I wondered what this failure would mean for my career, my relationship and my future.</p>
<p>Thankfully I was able to find a new job in Sheffield and after 18 months in regional PR I was given the opportunity to work at The University of Sheffield. I’ve been working here for nearly five years and I love my job, my work mates and the amazing projects that I am trusted to be part of.</p>
<p>In my time at the university I’ve been lucky to work in a team that is honest and supportive. I’ve spoken to these people about mental health and I’ve learned how we all have to find ways of coping with the situations that life throws at us. Many that are far more serious and important than me getting sacked.</p>
<p>By talking with people I’ve learned how much we all struggle in our own ways. It can be difficult to see how confident and competent people can be tearing themselves apart when nobody is watching.</p>
<p>It’s hard to let people into this imperfect version of yourself.</p>
<p>I’ve often existed behind a firewall of self-preserving indifference and constructed cynicism. This defence mechanism has held me back from making the most of opportunities and friendships so many times in life.</p>
<p>I suspect there are people who thought I was disinterested or aloof when I spoke to them. The truth is, I was trapped inside my own head. I wish I’d been more open and made more of the opportunities to know them better.</p>
<p>I make no claims to have any pertinent insights about any of this. I’ll never even be an expert in my own insecurities and anxieties.</p>
<p>However, here are a few things that I’ve found helpful…</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding a job that I really enjoy in an organisation that places trust in what I can do</li> 
<li>Working in an office with people that I consider to be some of my best friends</li>
<li>Talking to these friends openly about our lives and the shit we have to deal with</li>
<li>Talking even more honestly to my girlfriend about our respective anxieties and helping each other with them</li>
<li>Accepting that life is unfair and that bad things do happen</li>
<li>Being comfortable with making mistakes and accepting that sometimes I am a bit of a knob who does or says stupid things</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know why I decided to write this and share it with the world. I’m not sure it is useful or if it’s a bit self-indulgent. Either way, it was cathartic to write and if nothing else I hope it helps me be more open about things in future. There are a lot of people who I owe calls and messages to – and who I’ve been putting off talking to because I feel anxious about having let them down.</p>
<p>I’m aware that in the grand scheme of life I have been dealt a very fortunate hand. I don't want anyone to think I see this as some great struggle. It isn't, but the world is full of all our small struggles and it seems to help to talk about them.</p>
