        <hr />

        <p>In my desk I have an old iPod.</p>

<p>It's covered in scratches and scuffs from its noble years of service and my lack of care. For a long time I wouldn't dream of leaving the house without it.</p>

<p>Keys. Wallet. Phone. iPod. Headphones.</p>

<p>Now it sits like an artefact of a strange cultural waste management experiment. Several years of history and 80gb of landfill indie compressed onto a 46mm hard drive.</p>

<p>Almost every song revealed by its click wheel is available on Spotify now. My old iPod is redundant in almost every sense - but I can't bring myself to throw it away.</p>

<p>From time to time, I turn it on, plug in my headphones and head out with it clasped in my hand. I walk around listening only to songs that I chose for the soundtrack to an earlier part of my life.</p>

<p>When powered off this iPod is nothing but an old MP3 player full of 'acquired' (stolen) music. But when switched on, it is a wormhole to the late 2000s and a shortcut back to a cherished time.</p>

<p>I am proud to be part of the landfill indie generation.</p>

<p>I've seen a lot of debate online recently about 'landfill indie' prompted by <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bv8a8w/the-top-50-greatest-landfill-indie-songs-of-all-time">articles in Vice</a> and NME. I have no interest in an after the fact debate about the merits or shortcomings of music from those years. I have no interest in trying to define or redefine the term 'landfill indie.' I have no interest in whether you use that term in a positive or negative way.</p>

<p>I know what that music, and that period of time, means to me.</p>

<p>And it was the fucking best.</p>

<p>Or at least that is how I choose to remember it. Deep down I know it wasn't that simple. I know there was still anxiety. There were still arguments. There were still nights were we couldn't get in somewhere because someone didn't have ID.</p>

<p>There was still a lot of walking round wondering what they meant in their last message. There was a lot of wondering why they hadn't messaged back since then. A lot of wondering how they felt about you. A lot of wondering what would or would not happen next between you.</p>

<p>There was a lot of loneliness and a lot of tension.</p>

<p>There was a lot of darkness to bleed into the light.</p>

<p>I remember reading a quote at the time in a book I'd bought to try and seem cleverer than I was. It was a book called 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' by Milan Kundera - and it is a book I have still never read in full.</p>

<p>Early on enough in that book for me to have not lost interest, is the phrase:</p>

<p><i>"In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine."</i></p>

<p>For some reason, this quote has stuck with me in the 13 years or so since I first read it. At the time I thought it was a nice phrase and that I'd try and rip it off for a lyric or something.</p>

<p>Now, it makes more sense.</p>

<p>I let the aura of nostalgia illuminate everything from that period in my life. Even though I know it wasn't always so perfect and pure.</p>

<p>As I get older I worry that I am going to get trapped in the wormhole. That the nostalgia will blind me. That I will exist only in the embellished memories of a time that I will never be able to relive. That I walk around the landfill polishing every piece of scrap until it shines - from rubble to the ritz, if you will.</p>

<p>I find it hard to remember that there is more life to live and more moments to find the soundtrack for. That there is a still a present and a future, no matter how loud the past speaks to me when I switch on that old iPod. </p>
