        <hr />
        <p>It started with a twitch.</p>

        <p>I was working on my laptop in bed late one night in September 2019 when I felt my left eyelid start to twitch. This wasn't an uncommon occurrence to be honest. Hours can pass like seconds when staring at Photoshop, After Effects or Premiere. Sometimes the twitching of tired eyes is the necessary reminder to stop and go to bed.</p>
        
        <p>So I did.</p>
        
        <p>I lowered the lid of the laptop, pressed play on a podcast on my phone and soon fell asleep thinking nothing of it. After a few hours' sleep I woke the next morning in the usual no-man's land between rested and knackered.</p>
        
        <p>As I adjusted to the morning I noticed that my eye was still twitching away. Although surprised that sleep hadn't put the twitch to bed, I didn't think too much of it. I figured I needed a few more early nights to sort it.</p>
        
        <p>I'm sure it'll disappear in the next week or so, I thought.</p>
        
        <p>But it didn't.</p>
        
        <p>From this innocuous and boring event came a six month period of rampant health anxiety. The initial twitch spiralled into a cycle of destructive thoughts. Then came a fixation on the idea that something was very wrong with me.</p>
        
        <p>The idea that something was killing me plagued me like, well...like a constant twitching in the eye.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>I've always been prone to worrying about my health.</p>
        
        <p>It has never been in a logical way though. It's never practical concerns based on diet, or drinking or stuff like that.</p>
        
        <p>That stuff isn't dramatic enough to catch my imagination.</p>
        
        <p>It's easier to worry about stuff that feels more definitive and brutal. At various points it has been a brain tumour or motor neurone disorder or MS.</p>
        
        <p>It felt ridiculous and almost disrespectful to write that down. They are awful conditions that affect millions of people. They are not something to make light of and I'd never want to do that.</p>
        
        <p>But it is also true to say, they are the kinds of conditions that are easy to fixate on. A Google search for basic symptoms like "headache" or "muscle stiffness" will soon lead you to them.</p>
        
        <p>It's pretty obvious that you should never self-diagnose, but I'm willing to bet we've all done it. I can never resist putting together the puzzle pieces of symptoms into a picture of absolute doom.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>It was with grim inevitability that I googled "persistent eye twitch" one day in early October.</p>
        
        <p>The first search is never that bad.</p>
        
        <p>It brings reasonable suggestions like "not enough sleep" or "too much screen time."</p>
        
        <p>It also suggested a trip to the opticians - so I booked one, hoping that I needed some new glasses and that would be that.</p>
        
        <p>"Your prescription hasn't changed at all."</p>
        
        <p>Well..bollocks.</p>
        
        <p>I mentioned the twitch to the optometrist. He suggested it could be a magnesium deficiency and that he'd used dark chocolate to help with this in the past. He also mentioned that quinine was a muscle relaxant that you could get from tonic water.</p>
        
        <p>So that night I hammered dark chocolate and gin and tonic while searching symptoms online and starting to convince myself it was something more sinister.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>I would describe my health anxiety as a habit - and like all habits it is consistent and repeatable.</p>
        
        <p>It starts with noticing or perceiving a new symptom - in this case an eye twitch. Most things disappear in short order, but the ones that stick feel worth worrying about.</p>
        
        <p>The worries build up and this leads to attempts at self-diagnosis. Often the answers provided by Dr Google are enough to assuage the fears. But when the symptoms don't go, the fear grows again until another crisis point of panic.</p>
        
        <p>It is an hourglass of worries turned over and restarted day by day and week by week.</p>
        
        <p>The fixation on 'symptoms' leads, in turn, to obsessive checking. I spent hours staring at myself in the mirror looking at my eye and trying to work it out.</p>
        
        <p>I soon realised I could induce a twitch if I blinked hard - which led to many occasions of doing this in the mirror. Each time I'd have some renewed hope that it would've stopped - but, alas, it showed no signs of abating.</p>
        
        <p>After a few weeks the habits of self-diagnosing, checking and obsessing take hold. It was on my mind for most of the day as an irritating and unwelcome distraction from life.</p>
        
        <p>At good times I'd reassure myself that it was nothing and I was being daft. At bad times I'd convince myself it was something awful. I could switch from viewing it as tedious to terminal in the space of a single evening.</p>
        
        <p>One particularly bad day I decided enough was enough and booked an appointment with my GP.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>There is an inherent guilt about GP appointments when you are prone to health anxiety. It becomes hard to distinguish between genuine concerns and figments of imagination.</p>
        
        <p>As I sat and explained my symptoms to the doctor I felt this guilt creeping over me. There was something about his manner that suggested he'd been here before and had little time for it.</p>
        
        <p>I can understand why, and the last thing I'd ever want is to waste NHS time, which is why I felt like I shouldn't be there. But at the same time I felt like absolute shit and needed some level of help, even if it wasn't for the illness I'd imagined.</p>
        
        <p>He tried his best to humour me. He reassured me with explanations I'd already read (and dismissed) online. He told me to book some time off work and to book another appointment if things didn't improve.</p>
        
        <p>Spoiler: They didn't improve.</p>
        
        <p>I did book a week off but I spent most of it worrying. The more time that passed the less likely it felt that there was a simple and benign explanation. The odds seemed to be growing that it was something more - or at least that's how I was viewing it.</p>
        
        <p>It was around this time where I started to feel consumed by it and things got worse.</p>
        
        <p>The twitch was no longer in one eye alone, it was now in both, and then it was also my lip, and then my calf, and then my thumb. At this point I was twitching more than a teenage Fortnite streamer (If that doesn't make sense then ask your kids).</p>
        
        <p>I decided to go back to the GP - but this time I was thinking I'd ask for support with the anxiety as opposed to anything else.</p>
        
        <p>As I talked to him he asked me what I thought might be causing the muscle twitching. I reeled off a list of dramatic and drastic illnesses and conditions - some of which I'm not sure even he had heard of.</p>
        
        <p>He responded by saying he would refer me for an ophthalmology appointment. Part of me wonders if he did this because he thought I needed closure and a definitive answer to quell the anxiety.</p>
        
        <p>I wouldn't get this appointment until the new year, so I had to deal with Christmas while still in panic mode. It was without doubt the hardest festive season of my life. I wanted nothing more than to relax and enjoy it but there was a cloud of worries hanging over me at all times.</p>
        
        <p>Looking back now it seems ridiculous that it bothered me so much. I guess that's how anxious it was making me feel as I searched for answers going into the new year.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p> The ophthalmology appointment wasn't particularly exciting for the most part. They asked questions, they looked in my eyes, they stuck some cotton swabs up my eyelids etc.</p>
        
        <p>After the tests and a brief discussion with the consultant, the doctor returned to talk to me.</p>
        
        <p>I'll be honest, I wasn't quite prepared for what she said next.</p>
        
        <p>"There is nothing to suggest that anything dangerous or serious is causing this. You have had the muscle twitching for longer than we'd expect to see in someone of your age though. We'd like to refer you to our botox clinic..."</p>
        
        <p>As I heard the word "botox" a look of shock spread across my face. In hindsight, it was an expression I should have savoured. If she came at me with botox then I could lose the ability to do it again.</p>
        
        <p>I delayed her offer by saying I'd see how things went. I told her I would get back in touch if I wanted any neurotoxic protein injecting into my eye. Although, I admit, not quite in those words.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>I wish this story had a better ending. I wish I could say that the reassurance from my ophthalmology appointment changed things.</p>
        
        <p>The reality is though, it didn't.</p>
        
        <p>Nothing changed overnight.</p>
        
        <p>I still felt like shit and I still had weird muscle twitches.</p>
        
        <p>And then they stopped.</p>
        
        <p>I don't even remember when. It sounds like something I should remember after six months of worrying about it, but I don't.</p>
        
        <p>It must have happened over a period of days or weeks and I must've stopped noticing it.</p>
        
        <p>It feels like there should be some sort of lesson or message from this but I'm not sure there is. I know I am prone to health anxiety and I know that last year's was the worst bout of it I've ever had.</p>
        
        <p>As I sit here now in June 2020 I am fine and not too worried about anything in particular healthwise. I'm sure it won't be too long before I find something new to worry about to some degree.</p>
        
        <p>And then something else.</p>
        
        <p>I guess the sad inevitability of the hypochondriac is that one day they will actually be right.</p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <p>It's easy and glib to advocate the idea of talking more about mental health but it is true. For it to be worthwhile though, the conversation has to be honest and free from positivity porn.</p>
        
        <p>I don't have any advice or "top tips" for how I went from worrying to having "zen-like calm."</p>
        
        <p>It doesn't work like that.</p>
        
        <p>All I have is a story about being a mess for a while and then being less of a mess for a bit.</p>
        
        <p>But then, I guess that's all life is.</p>
